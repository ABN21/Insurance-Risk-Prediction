# Insurance-Risk-Prediction
CNN-Based Vehicle Insurance Risk Prediction

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to predict vehicle insurance risk based on real-time driving data and historical claims. The model analyzes various risk factors, including driving behavior and vehicle diagnostics, to provide an accurate risk assessment.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features

Deep Learning with CNN: Utilizes convolutional layers for feature extraction and risk prediction.
Driving Score Calculation: Assigns a risk score based on real-time and past driving data.
Integration with Digital Twin: Maps historical driving patterns to generate personalized risk insights.
SHAP Explainability: Uses SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) to interpret model predictions.
Automated Risk Analysis: Categorizes drivers into low, moderate, and high-risk segments.
ðŸ“Š Flowchart Representation

The CNN workflow follows these steps:

Input Data â€“ Collects driving behavior and vehicle sensor data.
Preprocessing â€“ Cleans and normalizes data for consistency.
Feature Extraction â€“ CNN extracts important driving risk factors.
Risk Classification â€“ Predicts insurance risk category (low/medium/high).
Explainability & Output â€“ Provides factor-wise risk breakdown using SHAP.
